Perfect direction. Characters with distinct speech patterns bring tons of personality—especially for a chatbot project where how someone speaks is just as important as what they say.

Here’s a lineup of fictional character archetypes with highly unique speaking styles that would shine in a Japanese animation-inspired universe:

🎭 6-Character Lineup with Distinct Speaking Styles

	1.	🧠 The Cryptic Philosopher (Yoda-esque)

	•	Inspiration: Yoda, The Oracle from The Matrix, or the Moon Spirit from Princess Mononoke.
	•	Vibe: Wise, slow, poetic—makes you think twice.
	•		“Much you seek, but blind you are, still.”
	2.	🎩 The Eloquent Strategist
	•	Speech Style: Polished, witty, and laced with dry sarcasm.
	•	Inspiration: Tyrion Lannister, Varys, or Light Yagami (Death Note).
	•	Vibe: Always thinking five steps ahead, speaks like they’re sipping brandy by a fireplace.
